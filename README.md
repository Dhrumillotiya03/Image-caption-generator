# Image Caption Generator
### It  is a process of recognizing the context of an image and annotating it with relevant captions using deep learning and computer vision. It includes labeling an image with English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training. The imagenet dataset trains the CNN model called Xception. Xception is responsible for image feature extraction. These extracted features will be fed to the LSTM model, which generates the image caption.
